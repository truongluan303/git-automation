A few scripts to automate git common usages.

Why do we even need these? Well, simply to make our lives easier. With these automation scripts, we can simple use `pushbr` instead of verbosely typing `git add.`, then `git commit`, and then `git push origin current-feature-branch`. These scripts included in this repo will cover the most popular git commands that developers use daily.
